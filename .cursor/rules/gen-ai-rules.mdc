Always only use plain ECMA script/JS never TypeScript.
Keep things separated as much as possible and SOLID principle. So if there is a CSS animation and styling for a specific part of the site, rather have a specific css-file for that. Try keeping everything in smaller components (pure HTML/JS) and following SOLID principles. Components is put in 2 categories. BaseComponents like a ModalDialog which is generic and can be reused for whatever purpose. Then specific AppComponents which could be SettingsDialog for application specific settings based on ModalDialog.

Keep components separated into folders like components\base and components\app and each component should have its own js and css file if specific and not generic css/js that applies for the entire site.
